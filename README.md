## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The key takeaways from the project are:

- Responsiveness: Using max-width property, media queries and relative units to ensure the output was reponsive across a wide range of devices.

- Fontawesome Icons: Was able to learn how to include Icons to my project using Font Awesome Kits. Also handled custom brand icons, like Frontend Mentor logo, which aren't included in the standard library, by using SVGs.

- Accessibility and semantics: Through the use of aria labels and unordered list.Also learned the use of rel="noopener noreferrer" attribute in HTML, which enhances security by preventing the new tab from knowing the origin of the traffic and manipulating the original tab.

- Improved my understanding on CSS custom properties.

### Continued development

- CSS Custom Properties
- Media Queries
